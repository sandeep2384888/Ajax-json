+ What is XML?

- XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language
- XML is a markup language much like HTML
- XML was designed to store and transport data
- XML was designed to be self-descriptive

+ What is JSON?

- Stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
- JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.
- JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation.
- When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text.
  JSON is text, and we can convert any JavaScript object into JSON, and send JSON to the server.
  We can also convert any JSON received from the server into JavaScript objects.
  This way we can work with the data as JavaScript objects, with no complicated parsing and translations.

+ What is AJAX?

- AJAX is an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It is a group of inter-related technologies like JavaScript, 
  DOM, XML, HTML/XHTML, CSS, XMLHttpRequest etc.
- AJAX allows you to send and receive data asynchronously without reloading the web page. So it is fast.
- AJAX allows you to send only important information to the server not the entire page. So only valuable data from the 
  client side is routed to the server side. It makes your application interactive and faster.
